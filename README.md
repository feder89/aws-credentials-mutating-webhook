# aws-credentials-mutating-webhook
This Webhook has the target to inject AWS credentials into a pod, getting ARNs details from annotations.
The project has been created with [kubebuilder](https://book.kubebuilder.io) 
It uses Kubernetes and AWS Go libraries to make the webhook working.


## Description
This project was born to fulfill the request to be authorized to do something on AWS even though the request comes from outside AWS itself.
So that [IAM Roles Anywhere](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/access-rolesanywhere.html) is one of the possible ways to aim it. 
In order to configure IAM Roles Anywhere, pleas read [this doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/getting-started.html).
The Webhook server must start up using a Certificate issued by the same CA used to create the Tust Anchor.
**AWS required configurations**:
- Trust Anchor (CA, self-signed is ok as well)
- Profile:
    - Policy like this:
    ```
        {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Statement": [
                {
                    "Sid": "ListObjectsInBucket",
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Action": [
                        "s3:ListBucket"
                    ],
                    "Resource": [
                        "arn:aws:s3:::onetag-aws-anywhere"
                    ]
                },
                {

                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Action": "s3:*Object",
                    "Resource": [

                    ]

                }
            ]
        }
    ```

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running Webhook on the cluster
1. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/aws-credentials-mutating-webhook:tag
```

2. Deploy required resources to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/aws-credentials-mutating-webhook:tag
```

3. deploy example container (k8s job):
```sh
make example-deploy
```

### Undeploy Webhook
UnDeploy the webhook resources from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.
